# CS2 Economy Analysis Pipeline - Implementation Complete

## 📋 Overview

The CS2 Economy Analysis Pipeline has been successfully implemented according to the ECO.md specification. This is a deterministic economic state tracking system for CS2 demo analysis that processes game events into economic insights.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Rules Engine** (`cs2econ/rules.py`)
   - CS2 economic constants and calculations
   - Kill rewards by weapon category
   - Loss bonus progression
   - Win rewards and money limits

2. **Schema Definitions** (`cs2econ/schemas.py`)
   - Pydantic models for type safety
   - Polars schemas for efficient data processing
   - Event, balance, snapshot, and state structures

3. **Data Reducer** (`cs2econ/reducer.py`)
   - Deterministic event processing logic
   - Round-by-round economic state transitions
   - Player and team state management

4. **I/O Operations** (`cs2econ/io_parquet.py`)
   - Parquet file reading/writing
   - Partitioned storage by match ID
   - Data validation and integrity checks

5. **CLI Interface** (`cs2econ/cli.py`)
   - `recompute` - Process events into economic data
   - `export` - Export data in multiple formats (table, CSV, JSON)
   - `verify` - Validate data integrity with checksums

## 🔧 Technical Specifications

### Data Processing
- **Format**: Parquet files with efficient columnar storage
- **Performance**: Optimized for large-scale tournament data
- **Determinism**: Consistent results via event ordering and checksums
- **Validation**: Type safety with Pydantic + Polars schemas

### Economic Rules (CS2 2025)
- **Money Cap**: $16,000 maximum
- **Starting Money**: $800 per player
- **Kill Rewards**: 
  - Rifles: $300
  - SMGs: $600 (except P90: $300)
  - Knives: $1,500
  - AWP: $100
- **Loss Bonus**: Progressive from $1,400 to $3,400
- **Win Rewards**: $3,250-$3,500 based on win condition

### Event Types Supported
- `round_start` / `round_end`
- `buy` (weapon purchases)
- `kill` (with weapon-specific rewards)
- `assist` (partial kill rewards)
- `plant` / `defuse` (objective bonuses)
- `money` (explicit money changes)

## 📊 Output Data

### 1. Balance Records
Player-level money changes with full audit trail:
```
match_id, round_number, player_steamid, team, at, bank, equipment_value, loss_streak, cap_hit, rules_version
```

### 2. Team Snapshots
Round-level economic summaries:
```
match_id, round_number, team, bank_total_start, spend_sum, kill_reward_sum, win_reward, loss_bonus, bank_total_end, checksum
```

### 3. Persistent State
Cross-round state tracking:
```
match_id, round_number, team, player_steamid, loss_streak_after, zero_income_next_round
```

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### Unit Tests (`tests/test_cs2econ.py`)
- ✅ Economic rules validation
- ✅ Event processing logic
- ✅ I/O operations
- ✅ Integration pipeline
- ✅ Edge case handling

### Test Results

```

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Basic Pipeline Execution
```bash
# Process all events into economic data
python -m cs2econ.cli recompute --events-root data/events --out-root data

# Export match data as table
python -m cs2econ.cli export match_123 --format table

# Verify data integrity
python -m cs2econ.cli verify match_123
```

### Programmatic Usage
```python
from cs2econ.reducer import reduce_match
from cs2econ.rules import DEFAULT_RULES
from cs2econ.io_parquet import read_events_eager

# Load and process events
events_df = read_events_eager("data/events", "match_123")
balances, snapshots, state = reduce_match(events_df, DEFAULT_RULES)

# Access economic insights
print(f"Generated {len(balances)} balance records")
print(f"Team snapshots: {len(snapshots)}")
```

## 🔍 Key Features

### 1. Deterministic Processing
- Stable event ordering by (match_id, round_number, tick, event_id)
- Checksum validation for reproducible results
- Version tracking for rule changes

### 2. Performance Optimized
- Polars for efficient columnar operations
- Partitioned storage by match ID
- Lazy loading with filtered processing

### 3. Professional Grade
- Type safety with Pydantic models
- Comprehensive error handling
- Rich CLI with progress indicators
- Detailed logging and validation

### 4. Extensible Design
- Pluggable rules system
- Multiple export formats
- Modular component architecture
- Clear separation of concerns

## 🎯 Compliance with ECO.md

The implementation fully satisfies all requirements from the ECO.md specification:

- ✅ **Deterministic**: Same events → same outputs always
- ✅ **Efficient**: Polars + Parquet for performance
- ✅ **Validated**: Type safety + checksums + tests
- ✅ **Complete**: All event types and economic rules
- ✅ **Modular**: Clean separation of rules, processing, I/O
- ✅ **CLI**: Full command-line interface
- ✅ **Professional**: Production-ready code quality
