**Executive Summary**
The Falcons vs. Vitality series features a high level of player mobility and utility usage across various maps. The most contested zones are located on Nuke and Dust II, with multiple teams engaging in intense gameplay. This report provides an analysis of the key insights, player spotlights, contested zones, caveats, and next actions to inform coaches' strategies.

**Key Insights**
* High player mobility: TeSeS (2603.8), m0NESY (2670.65) - evidence: `player_mobility` table (`mobility_score` column)
* Consistent utility usage: apEX (CFlashbang, 600272 throws), ZywOo (CSmokeGrenade, 466606 throws) - evidence: `utility_usage` table (`total_throws` and `maps_with_usage` columns)
* Most contested zones on Nuke and Dust II maps - evidence: `contested_zones` table (`demo_name`, `zone_x`, `zone_y`, and `teams_present` fields)

**Player Spotlights**

### 1. TeSeS
* Role hint: Aggressive AWPer
* Mobility score: 2603.8 (high) - evidence: `player_mobility` table
* Utility usage: CFlashbang (530600 throws), CSmokeGrenade (348695 throws) - evidence: `utility_usage` table

### 2. m0NESY
* Role hint: Flexible player, capable of playing AWPer or Lurker
* Mobility score: 2670.65 (high) - evidence: `player_mobility` table
* Utility usage: CFlashbang (492243 throws), CSmokeGrenade (377931 throws) - evidence: `utility_usage` table

### 3. apEX
* Role hint: IGL and AWPer
* Mobility score: Not available (below the threshold of 500 total ticks) - evidence: `player_mobility` table
* Utility usage: CFlashbang (600272 throws), CSmokeGrenade (473286 throws) - evidence: `utility_usage` table

**Contested Zones**

### 1. Nuke Map, Zone X: 2400.0, Zone Y: -400.0
* Total activity: 7597 ticks, teams present: 2
* Rationale: High total activity and presence of multiple teams indicate a highly contested zone.

### 2. Dust II Map, Zone X: 400.0, Zone Y: 2400.0
* Total activity: 3869 ticks, teams present: 2
* Rationale: Moderate total activity and presence of multiple teams suggest a moderately contested zone.

### 3. Nuke Map, Zone X: 1200.0, Zone Y: -400.0
* Total activity: 1580 ticks, teams present: 2
* Rationale: Low total activity but presence of multiple teams indicates a lightly contested zone.

### 4. Dust II Map, Zone X: 0.0, Zone Y: 2400.0
* Total activity: 2308 ticks, teams present: 2
* Rationale: Moderate total activity and presence of multiple teams suggest a moderately contested zone.

### 5. Nuke Map, Zone X: -400.0, Zone Y: -800.0
* Total activity: 1924 ticks, teams present: 2
* Rationale: Low total activity but presence of multiple teams indicates a lightly contested zone.

**Caveats**

* The analysis is based on limited data (5 maps) and may not be representative of the entire series.
* Player mobility scores are calculated using standard deviation, which may not accurately capture individual player performance.
* Utility usage is based on total throws, which may not account for contextual factors like game situation or opponent.

**Next Actions**

* Coaches should focus on developing strategies to counter high-mobility players (TeSeS, m0NESY) and adapt to changing utility usage patterns.
* Team composition and map selection should take into consideration the contested zones identified in this report.
* Further analysis of player performance across additional maps and demos is recommended to gain a more comprehensive understanding of team dynamics.
